# chargen

This repo includes the code (formatted for the perchance.org random generator) and the artwork for the Elder Scrolls Character Art Idea Generator available at ghostchoir9.com/charart

All images are property of their original creators, whose names and websites are listed in the code file. They're distributed here solely for fun and educational use. 

Using this repo, you can:
* view the images as a gallery and take the randomness out of the random generator
* download images by using the green CODE button above, then selecting Download zip, to use them offline 
* copy this code and use these images in your own generators for other media 
* submit a pull request to contribute to this generator directly. If you do so, you must provide both the code and images together.
